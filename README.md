# 🔐 SHA-256 CLI Cryptography Tool

A lightweight Python command-line tool for hashing messages using the SHA-256 cryptographic algorithm. Built for Linux environments.

## 🚀 Features

- Hash any message using **SHA-256**
- Simple **CLI-based interface**
- Designed for **Linux terminal**
- Pure Python (no external libraries required)

## 🧠 What is SHA-256?

SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit) is part of the SHA-2 family and is widely used in digital security. It transforms any input into a fixed 256-bit (64-character) hash.

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Linux OS

> ✅ No external dependencies required!

🔒 Disclaimer
This tool is meant for educational purposes and simple hashing tasks. It does not encrypt or decrypt data — it only hashes inputs using SHA-256.
